# Project Paralysis

There is this thing that I often deal with and I am calling it project paralysis. It is a spin off the concept of **analysis paralysis**, which is a "state of being unable to make a decision due
to excessive thinking about the options". In the tech industry and world of computer science, you have to keep up with the times. You have to sharpen your skills and learn new things -- especially if you want to be
competitive in the job market. One way of doing this is through project based learning. Building new things, using different stacks and languages to expand your knowledge and skills. Some might give the excuse of lack of motivation to
test these waters and try something different. I on the other hand, do not feel a lack of motivation when it comes to picking up my keyboard and getting to work. I get excited at the thought of building something new. I just do not know _what_ to build and what tools to use. There are an endless amount of avenues you can take when doing this process. You just have to pick one.
